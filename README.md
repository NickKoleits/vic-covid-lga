# COVID-19 by Victorian LGAs Visualisation
---

## Background

Overall, Australia has faired well compared to other developed nations in relation to COVID-19 cases. However, within Australia, Victoria has had the largest outbreak of cases among all states. Being a Melbournian myself, I've had a little extra spare time on my hands with the second round of stage 4 restrictions imposed from 3 August 2020. With this spare time, I decided to make an animated map of Greater Melbourne Local Government Areas (LGAs) to visualise the spread of COVID-19 cases in Greater Melbourne.

This project involves web-scarping of daily COVID-19 cases for Victorian LGAs to generate a time-lapse chloropleth map to visualise daily COVID-19 count and spread to highlight the incidence of:
1. Active cases; and
2. Cumulative cases.
